## Decorator Pattern
# Design Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Decorator Pattern Intent

<p>Attach additional resposnibilities to an object dynamically .
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
</p>

<p>
Decorator classes mirror the type of the component they decorate.
</p>

<p><em>Drawback</em><br/>
Decorators can result in many small objects in our design and overuse can be complex
